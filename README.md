- 👋 Hi, I’m @schick-moritz
- 👀 I’m interested in: real algebraic geometry, polynomial optimization, PSD polynomials, SOS polynomials, SONC polynomials
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: finding efficient ways of deciding membership to the SOS+SONC cone (i.e. polynomials that decompose into an SOS and a SONC part)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: everything related to the topics above
- 📫 How to reach me: moritz.schick@uni-konstanz.de
