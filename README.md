- 👋 Hi, I’m @schick-moritz
- 👀 I’m interested in: real algebraic geometry, polynomial optimization, positive semidefinite (PSD) polynomials, sums of squares (SOS) polynomials, sums of nonnegative circuit (SONC) polynomials
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: finding efficient ways of deciding membership in different cones of PSD polynomial; I particularly focus on SOS+SONC polynomials, i.e. polynomials that decompose into a sum of an SOS and a SONC polynomial
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: everything related to the topics above
- 📫 How to reach me: moritz.schick@uni-konstanz.de
